# Homebridge Pentair IntelliCenter Plugin
[![verified-by-homebridge](https://badgen.net/badge/homebridge/verified/purple)](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Verified-Plugins)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebridge-pentair-intellicenter.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-rinnai-controlr)

This plugin integrates with the Pentair IntelliCenter panel to expose its features to HomeKit/Siri. Currently, only the "Bodies", heaters, and circuits that are marked as "Features" in IntelliCenter will be exposed as switches in HomeKit.

Also, along with the [Homebridge Alexa plugin](https://github.com/NorthernMan54/homebridge-alexa), this plugin can be used to expose your IntelliCenter circuits to Alexa. As far as I know, this is currently the only Alexa integration as the Alexa skill for IntelliCenter is no longer available.
